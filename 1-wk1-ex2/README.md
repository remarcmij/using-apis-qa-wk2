# Week 1 - ex2-checkDoubleDigits

Folder: `1-wk1-ex2`

## Introduction

In the `ex2-checkDoubleDigits.js` exercise from last weeks an observant trainee from a previous cohort noticed that the output order of the console logs was not as expected. Expected was:

```plaintext
Expected a double digit number but got 9
This is a double digit number!
This is a double digit number!
Expected a double digit number but got 100
```

But the actual output was:

```plaintext
This is a double digit number!
This is a double digit number!
Expected a double digit number but got 9
Expected a double digit number but got 100
```

We can use Github Copilot to help us understand why this happens. The prompt that was given to Copilot and the response it generated is shown below.

## Prompt

When I run file#1-ex2-checkDoubleDigits.js I get this output:

This is a double digit number!  
This is a double digit number!  
Expected a double digit number but got 9.  
Expected a double digit number but got 100.  

I expected this order:

Expected a double digit number but got 9.  
This is a double digit number!  
This is a double digit number!  
Expected a double digit number but got 100.  

Why is the output order different than expected?

### What you expected

You expected the output to match the order of the function calls in `main()`:

1. `checkDoubleDigits(9)` (rejected)
2. `checkDoubleDigits(10)` (resolved)
3. `checkDoubleDigits(99)` (resolved)
4. `checkDoubleDigits(100)` (rejected)

So, you expected the error for 9 first, then the two successes, then the error for 100.

### What actually happens

The actual output is:

```plaintext
This is a double digit number!  
This is a double digit number!  
Expected a double digit number but got 9  
Expected a double digit number but got 100  
```

### Why does this happen?

- **Promises are asynchronous**: The executor function inside each Promise runs synchronously, but the `.then()` and `.catch()` handlers are always called asynchronously (in a microtask, after the current call stack).
- **All four `checkDoubleDigits` calls are started one after another, synchronously.**
- The order in which the microtasks (the `.then()`/`.catch()` handlers) are executed depends on when the promises are settled.

#### In your code

- For `checkDoubleDigits(9)`, the promise is **rejected immediately**.
- For `checkDoubleDigits(10)` and `checkDoubleDigits(99)`, the promises are **resolved immediately**.
- For `checkDoubleDigits(100)`, the promise is **rejected immediately**.

However, **in V8 (Node.js, Chrome, etc.), resolved promises' `.then()` handlers are placed in the microtask queue before rejected promises' `.catch()` handlers if they are created in the same tick**. This is because `.then()` is attached before `.catch()` for resolved promises, and the microtask queue processes them in the order they were added.

So, the two resolved promises (`10` and `99`) have their `.then()` handlers queued first, followed by the `.catch()` handlers for the rejected promises (`9` and `100`).

### Summary Table

| Call                   | Promise Settled | Handler Queued      | Output Order |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| `checkDoubleDigits(9)`   | rejected        | `.catch()`          | 3            |
| `checkDoubleDigits(10)`  | resolved        | `.then()`           | 1            |
| `checkDoubleDigits(99)`  | resolved        | `.then()`           | 2            |
| `checkDoubleDigits(100)` | rejected        | `.catch()`          | 4            |

### Conclusion

**The order of outputs is determined by the order in which the microtasks are queued, not the order of the function calls.**  
Resolved promises' `.then()` handlers are queued before rejected promises' `.catch()` handlers if all are created in the same synchronous block.

Thatâ€™s why you see the two success messages before the error messages.

## Alternative Solution

File `2-ex2-checkDoubleDigits.js` contains an alternative solution that uses `.then()` with two parameters, a `onFulfilled` handler and an `onRejected` handler. This causes resolved and rejected promises to be handler in the same microtask, ensuring the output order matches the expected one.

## Deeper Dive (optional)

The `annotated` folder contains versions of the files with comments indicating where promises and microtasks are created and resolved. These version use the custom Promise implementation we introduced last week, which allows us to see the order of microtasks more clearly.
