## Prompt

If a server sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *, what are the risks? Are there situations where that is safe or unsafe?

## Response

Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * means any origin can access your resource via cross-origin requests. This has both safe and unsafe implications depending on the context.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ When it is safe:

- Public APIs or assets: If the data is not sensitive (e.g. a public image CDN or weather API), allowing all origins is fine.
- Static resources: When the resource is meant to be embedded or consumed freely.
- No credentials involved: As per the CORS spec, Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * cannot be used with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è When it is unsafe:

- Sensitive data: If your endpoint returns user-specific or protected data, * allows malicious websites to fetch it via a user‚Äôs browser.
- Combining with credentials: If your API relies on cookies or Authorization headers, using * creates a serious risk (though the browser will block this by spec).
- CSRF-like risks: Even without credentials, APIs that mutate state (e.g. POST, DELETE) can be abused unless carefully restricted.

‚∏ª

üîí Best practice:

Use Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <https://your-client.com> instead of * for private APIs. This limits access to trusted origins.
