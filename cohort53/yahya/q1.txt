Prompt: When using JavaScript to make a fetch request in a browser, what is the difference between a simple request and a preflight request in CORS? And why is the OPTIONS method used in preflight?

-----

In CORS, when you make a fetch() request from the browser, the browser determines whether it’s a simple request or needs a preflight request.

🔹 Simple Request

A simple request meets all these conditions:
	•	Uses one of these methods: GET, HEAD, or POST
	•	Has only CORS-safelisted headers (e.g., Accept, Content-Type with value application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain)
	•	Does not use credentials: include unless the server supports it

If these are satisfied, the browser sends the request directly without any CORS negotiation.

🔹 Preflight Request

If any condition for a simple request is not met (e.g., method is PUT, custom headers are used, or non-safelisted Content-Type), the browser first sends a preflight request:
	•	Uses the OPTIONS method
	•	Includes headers like:
	•	Access-Control-Request-Method
	•	Access-Control-Request-Headers
	•	Origin

This is a safety check asking the server: “Are you OK with me sending this kind of request?”

🔸 Why OPTIONS?

The OPTIONS method is used because it’s designed to ask the server what methods and headers are supported—without triggering the actual resource operation (e.g., modifying data). It’s safe and side-effect free.

Summary:
	•	Simple = safe & allowed directly.
	•	Preflight = more complex, needs permission.
	•	OPTIONS = browser’s way of asking permission before sending the real request.
