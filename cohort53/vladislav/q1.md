## Question

I understand that CORS blocks some requests for security reasons, but it's still a bit unclear to me when exactly a "cross-origin" request is triggered. Could you share a simple example of such a case in practice? And what are some options a frontend dev has to deal with it?

## Answer

We discussed this during the session. See also the 6-cors folder.
