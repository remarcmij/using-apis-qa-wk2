## Question

Why is the promise resolved immediately rather than after a timeout?

## codellama:13b: Wrong

The promise in the code is resolved immediately because it is not waiting for the setTimeout function to complete before resolving the promise. The setTimeout function returns an ID that can be used to cancel the timer, but it does not block the execution of the code.

To resolve the promise after a timeout, you can use the Promise.resolve() method with a delay:

```js
async function sleepy() {
  const result = await Promise.resolve(42).delay(5000);
  console.log('I’m awake');
  return result;
}
```

This will resolve the promise after a 5-second delay, and the console.log statement will be executed after the delay.

## GPT-4o: Correct

The promise in the `sleepy` function is resolved immediately because of a mistake in how the `setTimeout` function is being used. Specifically, the `setTimeout` function is being invoked incorrectly:

```javascript
new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r(42), 5000));
```

Here’s what’s happening:

1. **`r(42)` is called immediately**: Inside the `setTimeout`, the `r(42)` function is being executed immediately because the parentheses `()` invoke the function. This means the `r` function (the resolver of the promise) is called with the value `42` before the `setTimeout` even starts.

2. **`setTimeout` receives the return value of `r(42)`**: The return value of `r(42)` (which is `undefined` because `r` doesn’t explicitly return anything) is passed to `setTimeout`. As a result, `setTimeout` doesn’t delay anything and the promise resolves immediately.

### Correct Usage

To fix this issue, you need to pass a function reference to `setTimeout` instead of invoking the function directly. Here’s the corrected code:

```javascript
async function sleepy() {
  const result = await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(() => r(42), 5000));
  console.log('I’m awake');
  return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Arrow function as a wrapper**: By wrapping `r(42)` in an arrow function `() => r(42)`, you ensure that the `r` function is only called after the `setTimeout` delay (5 seconds in this case).
- **Deferred execution**: The `setTimeout` now waits for 5 seconds before executing the arrow function, which resolves the promise with the value `42`.

### Key Takeaway

When using `setTimeout` with promises, always pass a function reference (or a function expression) as the first argument to ensure the delay works as intended. Avoid invoking the function directly.
