## Prompt

Why is the promise resolved immediately rather than after a timeout?

## Response

The promise in the `sleepy` function is resolved immediately because of a mistake in how the `setTimeout` function is being used. Specifically, the `setTimeout` function is being invoked incorrectly:

```javascript
new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r(42), 5000));
```

Here’s what’s happening:

1. **`r(42)` is called immediately**: Inside the `setTimeout`, the `r(42)` function is being executed immediately because the parentheses `()` invoke the function. This means the `r` function (the resolver of the promise) is called with the value `42` before the `setTimeout` even starts.

2. **`setTimeout` receives the return value of `r(42)`**: The return value of `r(42)` (which is `undefined` because `r` doesn’t explicitly return anything) is passed to `setTimeout`. As a result, `setTimeout` doesn’t delay anything and the promise resolves immediately.

### Correct Usage

To fix this issue, you need to pass a function reference to `setTimeout` instead of invoking the function directly. Here’s the corrected code:

```javascript
async function sleepy() {
  const result = await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(() => r(42), 5000));
  console.log('I’m awake');
  return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Arrow function as a wrapper**: By wrapping `r(42)` in an arrow function `() => r(42)`, you ensure that the `r` function is only called after the `setTimeout` delay (5 seconds in this case).
- **Deferred execution**: The `setTimeout` now waits for 5 seconds before executing the arrow function, which resolves the promise with the value `42`.

### Key Takeaway

When using `setTimeout` with promises, always pass a function reference (or a function expression) as the first argument to ensure the delay works as intended. Avoid invoking the function directly.
