Q7: May you create an example using ONLY the async-await syntax, without using the class keyword Promise, and the same example, using Promise.then syntax?

An async function by itself can only create immediately settled promises (either resolved or rejected). If you want a promise that
is settled some time later you either need to create a promise
yourself (e.g. with new Promise()) or call a function such as
fetch() that returns a promise.
