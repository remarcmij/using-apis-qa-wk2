## Prompt

When should I use `async/await` instead of `.then/.catch` when working with APIs? Are there situations where one is clearly better?

## Response

Use `async/await` when:

- Readability matters: Code looks more like synchronous flow, especially with multiple sequential await calls.
- Error handling is simpler: You can use try/catch blocks instead of chaining .catch() on each Promise.
- Youâ€™re inside an async function and need to await results naturally.

Use `.then/.catch` when:

- Chaining multiple independent promises, especially when parallel execution is preferred.
- Youâ€™re outside an async function, like top-level in older JS environments (though modern ones support top-level await).
- Interoperability is needed, like working with libraries that expect Promises or in .map() callbacks.

Clearly better?

Yes:

- Use `async/await` for linear, sequential API calls with clear error handling.
- Use `.then/.catch` for branching logic or multiple concurrent API calls, often combined with `Promise.all()`.

ðŸ‘‰ In modern JavaScript, prefer `async/await` unless thereâ€™s a specific reason not to.
