## Prompt

If an API is unstable or sometimes slow, what are some strategies to make the user experience smoother?

## Response

To handle unstable or slow APIs and improve UX, consider these strategies:

1. Loading Indicators

    Show a spinner or skeleton UI immediately to signal that work is in progress.

2. Timeouts

    Use AbortController with fetch to cancel requests that take too long:

    ```js
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

    try {
      const res = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
      // handle success
    } catch (err) {
      // handle timeout or abort
    }
    ```

3. Retries with Backoff

    Retry failed requests with exponential delay:

    ```js
    const retryFetch = async (url, retries = 3, delay = 500) => {
      for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
        try {
          return await fetch(url);
        } catch (err) {
          if (i === retries - 1) throw err;
          await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, delay * 2 ** i));
        }
      }
    };
    ```

4. Graceful Fallbacks

    Show cached data, a helpful message, or reduced functionality if the API fails.

5. Progressive Enhancement

    Load core content first, then enhance with API data once itâ€™s available.

6. Debouncing/Throttling

    Reduce the number of API calls for search inputs or live updates.

7. Client-Side Caching

    Use localStorage or in-memory cache to avoid repeat requests for the same data.

    Together, these techniques can make an unstable API feel smoother and more resilient to users.
