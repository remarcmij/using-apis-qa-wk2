This folder contains three example applications that demonstrate different methods for fetching data from REST APIs. Each example uses the same JSONPlaceholder API to display data, but uses a different technique for making HTTP requests.

## What's Inside

- **1-fetch/**: Modern JavaScript using the Fetch API
- **2-xmlhttprequest/**: Classic approach using XMLHttpRequest
- **3-axios/**: Third-party library approach using Axios

All examples fetch data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free fake REST API for testing and prototyping.

## Historical Context

Understanding the evolution of JavaScript HTTP requests helps explain why we have these different approaches:

### XMLHttpRequest (2006)

- **Origin**: Introduced with Internet Explorer 7
- **Purpose**: Enabled AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) - the ability to update web pages without full page reloads
- **Era**: Dominated JavaScript development for nearly a decade
- **Legacy**: Still supported in all browsers today

### Fetch API (2015)

- **Origin**: Introduced as a modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest
- **Purpose**: Provide a cleaner, promise-based API for HTTP requests
- **Era**: Part of the ES6+ modern JavaScript revolution
- **Adoption**: Now the standard for modern web development

### Axios (2016)

- **Origin**: Created as a popular third-party library
- **Purpose**: Provide additional features and better developer experience than native Fetch
- **Era**: Rose to prominence in the React/Node.js ecosystem
- **Philosophy**: "Batteries included" approach with sensible defaults

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use XMLHttpRequest When

- Working with legacy codebases (pre-2015)
- Supporting very old browsers
- Learning about the fundamentals of HTTP requests
- Working in environments where modern JavaScript isn't available

### Use Fetch API When

- Building modern web applications
- You want to use native browser APIs
- Bundle size is a concern
- You're comfortable handling promise-based APIs
- You don't need advanced features like request/response interceptors

### Use Axios When

- You need advanced features (interceptors, automatic transforms, timeout handling)
- Working in a team that values consistent APIs
- Building complex applications with many API calls
- You want built-in protection against common pitfalls
- Working with both browser and Node.js environments

## Pros and Cons Comparison

### XMLHttpRequest

**Pros:**

- Universal browser support (including IE6+)
- No external dependencies
- Fine-grained control over request lifecycle
- Synchronous and asynchronous support

**Cons:**

- Verbose and complex syntax
- Callback-based (can lead to callback hell)
- No built-in JSON parsing
- Manual error handling required
- Not intuitive for beginners

### Fetch API

**Pros:**

- Clean, modern syntax
- Promise-based (works great with async/await)
- Built into modern browsers
- Streaming support
- No external dependencies

**Cons:**

- No support for IE (requires polyfill)
- Doesn't reject on HTTP error status (4xx, 5xx)
- No built-in timeout handling
- No automatic request/response transforms
- Limited progress tracking capabilities

### Axios

**Pros:**

- Excellent developer experience
- Automatic JSON parsing
- Built-in error handling for HTTP errors
- Request/response interceptors
- Timeout handling
- Automatic CSRF protection
- Works in both browser and Node.js
- Extensive configuration options

**Cons:**

- External dependency (~13KB minified)
- Adds bundle size to your application
- Learning curve for advanced features
- Potential overkill for simple applications

## Running the Examples

Each folder contains an `index.html` file that you can open directly in your browser:

1. **Fetch Example**: Open `1-fetch/index.html`
2. **XMLHttpRequest Example**: Open `2-xmlhttprequest/index.html`
3. **Axios Example**: Open `3-axios/index.html`

All examples provide the same functionality:

- Select a resource type from the dropdown
- Fetch data from JSONPlaceholder API
- Display the JSON response
- Handle errors gracefully

## Learning Recommendations

**For Beginners:**

1. Start with XMLHttpRequest to understand the fundamentals
2. Move to Fetch API to learn modern JavaScript patterns
3. Try Axios to see how libraries can improve developer experience

**For Modern Development:**

- Use **Fetch** for simple applications
- Use **Axios** for complex applications with multiple API calls
- Avoid XMLHttpRequest unless supporting legacy browsers
